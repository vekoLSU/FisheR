# About Our Software

Our project is a game called FISHER. In this game you, the player, live in a town where you set out on a boat to different areas of the map to catch unique fish. The aim of the game is to catch all of the fish and sell them for better upgrades to your rod, equipment, and skills. The fishing is made with an rpg frame in mind as you fight the fish when catching it. You are constantly in a battle of tension between you and the fish. The heavier the fish and the species of the fish determine how hard it is to catch the fish. The bigger the better however, as the heavier and more unique fish sell for more allowin you to upgrade faster. The town is free roam and allows for npc conversation, buying, and selling.
